-- <	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.

-- 	- When this option is set to "backslash", backslash is used. This is
-- 	  useful when editing a batch file with 'shellslash' set on Windows.
-- 	- When this option is empty, same character is used as for
-- 	  'shellslash'.
-- 	For Insert mode completion the buffer-local value is used.  For

-- string	(default "$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/swap//")
-- 			global
-- 	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
-- 	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
-- 	  possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last
-- 	  directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
-- 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
-- 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
-- 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
-- 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
-- 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
-- 	  use '//', instead of '\\'.
-- 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
-- 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
-- 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
-- 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
-- 	  of the option is removed.
-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
-- 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
-- 	home directory is tried first.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
-- 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
-- 	uses another default.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
